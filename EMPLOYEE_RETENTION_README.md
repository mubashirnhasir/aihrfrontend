## API Endpoints

### GET /api/employee-retention/predict

Returns predictions for all employees with mock data.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "department": "Engineering",
      "prediction": {
        "riskScore": 25,
        "riskLevel": "Low",
        "confidence": 0.85
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "totalEmployees": 135,
    "highRisk": 16,
    "mediumRisk": 36,
    "lowRisk": 83
  }
}
```

### POST /api/employee-retention/predict

Predicts retention for a specific employee.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "jobSatisfaction": 7,
  "engagementLevel": 8,
  "tenure": 3.5,
  "workLifeBalance": 6,
  "salarySatisfaction": 7,
  "careerGrowth": 6,
  "managerRelationship": 8,
  "performanceScore": 8
}
```

### GET /api/employee-retention/analytics

Returns comprehensive analytics and trends data.

## Prediction Algorithm

The current implementation uses a simple scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **Job Satisfaction** (0-10): Lower scores add higher risk
2. **Engagement Level** (0-10): Lower engagement increases risk
3. **Tenure**: New hires and very long-tenured employees may have higher risk
4. **Work-Life Balance** (0-10): Poor balance increases risk
5. **Salary Satisfaction** (0-10): Dissatisfaction with compensation adds risk
6. **Career Growth** (0-10): Limited growth opportunities increase risk
7. **Manager Relationship** (0-10): Poor relationships add risk
8. **Performance Score** (0-10): Low performance may indicate disengagement

**Risk Levels:**

- **Low Risk**: Score 0-29 (typically satisfied employees)
- **Medium Risk**: Score 30-59 (may need attention)
- **High Risk**: Score 60+ (immediate intervention recommended)

## Testing

### 1. Sample Data

The module includes sample data in `/lib/sampleData.js` for testing purposes.

### 2. API Testing

You can test the APIs using:

```bash
# Get all predictions
curl http://localhost:3000/api/employee-retention/predict

# Predict for specific employee
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/employee-retention/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jobSatisfaction": 7, "engagementLevel": 8, "tenure": 3.5, "workLifeBalance": 6, "salarySatisfaction": 7, "careerGrowth": 6, "managerRelationship": 8, "performanceScore": 8}'

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/employee-retention/analytics
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: Ensure employee data is properly anonymized and secured
2. **Access Control**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **GDPR Compliance**: Consider data protection regulations
4. **Audit Logging**: Track who accesses prediction data

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real ML Integration**: Replace mock algorithm with actual machine learning models
2. **Historical Analysis**: Add trend analysis over longer periods
3. **Intervention Tracking**: Monitor the effectiveness of retention actions
4. **Benchmark Comparisons**: Compare against industry standards
5. **Mobile App**: Create mobile interface for managers
6. **Integration APIs**: Connect with popular HR platforms (Workday, BambooHR, etc.)
